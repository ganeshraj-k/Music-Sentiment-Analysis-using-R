11,linkin park,Meteora,Starving Artist,"Cause every man's gotta do that thing to eatBefore he finds himself face down, passed out in the streetBut I ain't down for this industry9 to 5 to stay alive even though it's killing meAnd I'm hungry for the limelightHungry for the high life, thirsty for the fine wineAnd I'm hungry for that microphoneHungry for the live showsThirsty at the finish lineStarving artists follow your heartI know sometimes getting started's likeThe hardest partBut I'll die starving to follow this markAnd I'm going hungryNow tell me why you would ever wantTo live a life where all you're doingIs passing time until you die?And if I struggle, then I struggle forThe things that I'm trying to accomplishBefore the finish line. YeahI know you feel like every chance thatYou ever had to do the things you loveIs all gone without a traceBut it's the echoes of the pastAnd the happier times you hadTrying to escape show in linesAcross your face. And I trace em togetherYour face a constellationDrawn every morning through the steamAfter my shower's doneAnd there's some major to minorInstead I'm sick of waitingPointing straight to the sunI'll show you how it's doneAnd I'm trying hard to reach youBlowing through your speakersTrying to get inside your mindAnd I'm dying just to break throughStill I gotta eat, tooStill I gotta get byAnd if I shine, then you shine right backAnd we all in this togetherIf you feeling life is still a dreamAnd me? I'm floating down the riverAnd I ain't looking back!While I see packs of ratsTrying to swim upstreamMind is much clearer, life is so realerWine is much sweeterPancakes with the syrup!Cause one day, none of this will every matterIn the long runDJ in Heaven keeping track ofHow many times your song's spunBut in a moment it's history we createWith misery we replace so toBusy us in our day. And still you justCan't mistake the way that it feels to say""I love this song"" and watching the grinSpread on our face. Yeah!That's that shit that's worth living forAdam got a sicker flowSimilar to the kitchen thoughSometimes I swear, it's like I feelI'm on a mission, so had to break outIn flight because I feel like I'm in a prison, yoAnd life is nothing perfect, present tenseCause art is Heaven sent. I went from lawyerTo being my own employer, manThat's why I need to pedal wares and sell mySingle. So please excuse the shameless self-promotionOver strings and snares. YeahYou can give to your heart's contentI'm simply without repentanceI'm needing like every centI need it to pay the rentI need it for live eventsI need it to pay the billsFor the money already spent"
